        Today I woke up, crust in my eye, ready for another day. 
        My goal is to pass my Security Plus cert for my A.A.S. Haven't touched it since 2022. 
        There is a lot of concepts that I don't understand but it'll be worth it to 
        give it a shot. <br>
        <br>
        However, I want to do Linux Plus first since I've used Linux 
        for 2 years. I am aware other subjects in the cert I need to do but 
        I wouldn't mind giving a go fist then study later. One of the subjects I'm working 
        on is networking. Hate it. But it's becoming much needed skill in the 
        IT field. <br>

        <br>
        Took a class on networking last spring and I couldn't understand 
        the concepts of networking. Although I did really well, getting an B, most of the materials I've learnt
        slipped back of my mind. The person whom helped me the most is Jeffery. He is an awesome person. <br>

        <br>
        I need to warm up on networking, ASAP. Got to take advantage of the 
        free certs. Yes, free. That's why I'm doing it, free. <br>
        <br>
        
        Oh! Something I want to do on this is page is make an acidemic on my webpage to
        put my notes online for anyone to look at. I think it would be great to try out as 
        I am in the process of finishing my summer semster and taking discrete mathematics upcoming
        fall semster. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

        Discrete mathematics is weird. It's like logic but in math form. It is hard to explain it as 
        YouTube doesn't help me what is it. I didn't try to do any problems on my own, which explains my 
        confusion.
