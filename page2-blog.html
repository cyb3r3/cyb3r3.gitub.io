        Today I woke up, crust in my eye, ready for another day. 
        My goal is to pass my Security Plus cert for my A.A.S. Haven't touched it since 2022
        There is a lot of concepts that I don't understand but it'll be worth it to 
        give it a shot. <br>
        <br>
        However, I want to do Linux Plus first since I've used Linux 
        for 2 years. I am aware other subjects in the cert I need to do but 
        I wouldn't mind giving a go fist then study later. One of the subjects I'm working 
        on is networking. Hate it. But it's becoming much needed skill in the 
        IT field.
