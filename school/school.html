  <p style="width: 500px; font-size: 23px"> Who doesn't
    like school? Anyone, but
    I love school. So I am one of those weird people who
    would make a page all about their shcool work.
    <br />
    <br />
    I will document every work I do, free for anyone to
    use with secondary resources! Documentation is more work than what I am doing
    (discrete math) but it is all worth it.
    <br />
    <br />
    Your pain is my pain if you are struggling how to use symbols in discrete math.
