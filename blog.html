        Welcome to the blog page as I talk about whatever I do here.
        Whether it is good or bad, I want to share a bit of my personal
        life here. Not all of course... <br>
        <br>
        This website is for me to workout on my framework and github skills. As I am 
        adding pages like my landing page, I am wonder how much I can
        decor my webpage before I turn old anf forget that I made a page to 
        talk all bout me. <br>
        <br>
        I want to keep this webpage looking nice and not use any crazy shit like 
        most web devs nowadays. No shade, no shade. I am aware this source code isn't 
        the best. Still learning how to use CSS and HTML but CSS doesn't work for me on a 
        sepreate file. Wtf am I doing wrong? No clue and I would have to find that out later
        because I need to learn how to use github. <br>
        <br>
        Sure, I have been on git for 2 or 3 years but rarely on. I thought I wouldn't 
        need to use it. 2024, here I am using git. Haha!
