        School started 4 days. The courses I am taking are Discrete Math (hard but really fun), History to 1877, and Cisco Automation Switches. 
        I've been pouring time into more discrete math than the other course. Whoops. I should do that now instead... but I have no idea of what to do in history, same with cisco.
        The teacher is a real sweetheart but the instruction aren't clear and I don't want to point fingers at the teacher, that would make me look bad but I still
        want to balance all 3 courses so I can maintain a good GPA.

        Should I pull my head out or keep it level-headed?
