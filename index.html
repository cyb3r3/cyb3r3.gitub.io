        <h2>Who am I? </h2>
    
        <p>Community college student who is majoring in
        computer science and cyber sec. I love talking about tech as I am constanly learning new and old subjects. 
        Talk to me about it and I will not stop. Ever. Big 'ol warning there.
        </p>
        
        <p>My days are spent on coding, 
        repairing/maintaining machines as a technician at
        my contract job and studying computer <br>
        architecture & programming. </p>
        
        <h1>What else should you know?</h1>
        <p>
            You can contact me but please take no offense if I don't respond in time. Not much of a talker as I enjoy spending time to myself. <br>
            <br>
            But don't be afraid of talking to me! 
            <br>
