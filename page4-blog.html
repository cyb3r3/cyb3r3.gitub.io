        Today has been an boring day for me. I passed 2 summer courses but <br />
        haven't done anything productive. I could been building projects in C, JAVA, and Python...
        But I've been washed up in my skills all thanks to YouTube vidoes that teached me basic coding skills
        instead of going beyond my skills. It's a bad habit. I'm stuck,
        I can't think of what feild I want to go into. I knwo it's SWE
        but I don't think I'm good enough to learn. Maybe just give up?
        <br />
        <br />
        I know giving up is the easy part. But what options I have left? Not
        too many, hm? The job market for tech is bad at the moment. I would have
        to step it up, put value into my project instead of making a C oxford program.
        <br />
        <br />
        I do enjoy C, JAVA, and Python. I'm more familiar with C based languages, not
        JAVA. I suck at it!! JAVA is pretty but messy languages out there. I do like
        the syntax and other features of it that make it one of the languages that
        I should invest more. I am not trying to rack up many languages or use up to
        date languages. The thing is, what can I build with these languages? Coal
        mind?
